### [Histoire(s) du cinéma, Jean-Luc Godard, 1989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4r9xXe3P6w)

Because Ethics & Technology is movie series, this proposals reflects on the medium of the cinema itself.

This movie, or better audio-visual essay, shows how the cinema is wonderful, but also horrible, visionary, but also subjected to the industry of capitalism in the same way technology is.
   
“Histoire(s) du cinéma is the story of a Fall in the Biblical sense, a fall from the innocence of a Garden of Eden.” 

Technology is always introduced to the public as helpful and for the people, but it is often a double edges sword where we can easily lose control of its direction and who is in charge of it.

Similarly Jean-Luc Godard in Histoire(s) du cinéma forgets part of history, their original meaning and reassembles events in a new order. Who is in charge to decide how to present what happens?

Histoire(s) du cinéma is about the oblivion of history, in the same way technology and social media are not just telling facts, but they shape their narrative and existence.

Even though the techniques used to make those assemblage are obvious (cutting, trimming, flashing, layering). Histoire(s) du cinéma and today's media do not loose their ability in transforming our social relationships.

Images have gained a huge importance in the cultural and politic spheres and are able to influence our most intimate ways of interactions. (Rose, G 2001, Visual Methodologies)

By presenting not only one history, but all the possible ones '(s)', Godard implies that the Cinema is over (Rosenbaum 2013). In the same way the Media, by exhausting the course of events, implies that us and our history are true only through their voice.

What would be remembered about us and our relationships during the Covid-19 pandemic?
How deep is technology shaping who we are and the memory of us?

### [Parallels I-IV, Harun Farocki, 2012-2014](http://www.vdb.org/titles/parallel-i-iv)

Harun Farocki assembles a collection of images to question how image-making technology can be used to shape public perception.
When in computer graphic anything is virtually possible, how do we define what are the rules of what is possible or even ethical?

“Computer animations are currently becoming a general model, surpassing film. 
In films, there is the wind that blows and the wind that is produced by a wind machine. 
Computer images do not have two kinds of wind.”
– Harun Farocki  

Everything in the video-game world is generated for the user, indeed the narrator of Parallels asks:  
"Does the world exist, if I am not watching it?"

Is not a mere speculation on the medium of moving images: how can we believe, or even question, the offscreen space if it could be anything? 
Eventually, how do we believe the world we are or live in?  

Even if all offscreen spaces  are, at the beginning, imaginary (because we don't know if or when it will reveal itself), in the Cinema this space is dependent on the same physical laws of our own existence. Video-games, on the other hand, have a peculiarity: they work on an abstraction, a fictional world where only certain actions are allowed.

This is one of the most interesting aspects related to the responsibility of creating digital images that Parallels highlights: the fact that the more realistic the abstraction becomes, the more wider the delta between the simulation and reality gets.  

### [Minority Report, Steven Spielberg, 2002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG7DGMgfOb8)

It is set primarily in Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia in the year 2054, where PreCrime:, a specialized police department, apprehends criminals based on foreknowledge: provided by psychics called "precogs".

People are convicted for crimes they will make in the future, but that they haven't commit yet at the time of arrest.

Till where can we push technology?

How much can we surveil, control, acquire data in order to 'be safe'?

Steven Spielberg consulted a group of expert to imagine a realistic future for the year 2054, could be interesting to revisit their ideas and intuitions after 20 years.
