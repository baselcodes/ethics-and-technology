# Ethics & Technology Meeting 2021-01-18

## Website

* The sketch file was uploaded to Figma, the link is in slack
* A new (private) repository is available for the e&t webseite. It is based on [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) for frontend and [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) for backend.
* The website is hooked to [Vercel preview](https://ethics-and-technology-nuxt.vercel.app/) for deployment. Whenever pushing to the special branch `deploy` a build should be triggered. For the development we can use the `main` branch.
