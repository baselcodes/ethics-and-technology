A regular event every 2 months that aims at discussing the broader topic of ethics & technology in smaller sub-topics (e.g. labour & tec, surveillance/privacy, etc).
The first few events will take at the Garage (where Maxâ€™s office is). The costs for the space (100.-) we try to cover trough a small kollekte/fee (5.-) for the participants, the rest we cover ourself. We expect between 20 and 30 people.
The events will be communicated trough the website (which can also hold additional resources for each sub-topic/issue), instagram and word of mouth
